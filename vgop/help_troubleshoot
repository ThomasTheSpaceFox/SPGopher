q: I'm seeing alot of lines with "[NS]" or "[NS:x]" (where x is some random symbol), at the beginning. what do they mean?
a: This is Zoxenpher's way of showing a gopher item type its unable to use, or in the latter case, doesn't even recognize.

q: i see:
pErrorImage	/	about:gaierror.png	70
a: This means Zoxenpher wasn't able to load that content.  This can be for a variety of reasons, ranging from dead links to server bugs to bugs in Zoxenpher itself.

q: i see some sort of error page/error window with a 'zoxenpher error code':
a: You can look up the error code here:
1Error Codes	/	about:help_errorcodes	70

q: A connection seems to have hanged.
a: wait 20 seconds. this is the default timeout pereod for the connection. OR, close down zoxenpher. Zoxenpher is written in such a way that a hanged connection SHOULD NOT stop it from exiting.

q: A menu or text document is scrolling slowly
a: Unfortunately, Zoxenpher does not handle massive text documents and menus that well. So, you will run into the odd situation where zoxenpher runs rather poorly when displaying alot of text at once.

q: the text is too small/too big in menus.
a: you can change the font size and vertical spacing via the cnf.dat file.

q: the menus are not using a monospace font!
a: this means you will need to manually set a system font to be used via the cnf.dat file.
