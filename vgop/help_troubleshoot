q: I'm seeing alot of lines with "[NS]" or "[NS:x]" (where x is some random symbol), at the beginning. what do they mean?
a: This is Zoxenpher's way of showing a gopher item type its unable to use, or in the latter case, doesn't even recognize.

q: i see "Zoxenpher was unable to load the specified gopher address!" or
pErrorImage	/	about:gaierror.png	70
a: This means Zoxenpher wasn't able to load that content.  This can be for a variety of reasons, ranging from dead links to server bugs to bugs in Zoxenpher itself.

q: A connection seems to have hanged.
a: wait 20 seconds. this is the default timeout pereod for the connection. OR, close down zoxenpher. Zoxenpher is written in such a way that a hanged connection SHOULD NOT stop it from exiting.
