--- Basics of gopher ---

Gopher is really just one massive series of menus. each menu has various sorts of "selectors". These selectors are like gopher's equivalent to "links". Notice how some slectors are not treated as links. Text, and in zoxenpher's case, unsupported gopher types, being notable examples.

Zoxenpher has some important features relating to links. Such as with links to other menus, rightclick opens it in a new window. For all links, clicking while holding the shift key brings up an add bookmarks dialog. And another helpful feature: the gopher URL of a link (in the window that has focus) is shown in the hud bar above, upon hovering the mouse over said link. try it!

Finding information on gopher has the same solution as the web. search engines of course. A notable example is floodgap's "veronica 2" search engine. (link provided in splash page) Across gopher, you will find queries (also called ask, index search, etc.). These queries, when clicked, will open a special query entry box. enter your query in this box and your results should open in a new window once they have been loaded.

Things to remember:

server root: This is the highest menu of the gopher server.
