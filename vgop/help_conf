--- Overview ---

Zoxenpher currently lacks any in-program options menu, so you will need to setup cnf.dat file manually to alter the default settings.

--- Creating cnf.dat ---

look in the subdirectory called "usr" (the one in the directory where zoxenpher.py is).  You should see a file called cnf.example. 

copy cnf.example as cnf.dat and open it in a code editor, or very basic text editor. DO NOT USE A WORD PROCESSOR!

Now, refer to the sections below to find the setting you wish to change.


--- Setting wallpaper ---
1see: wallpaper help	/	about:help_wallpaper	70

--- Fixing menu font ---

On some systems, the default settings will end up loading a non-monospaced font, or wind up being the wrong size.


 -To change the size, use a setting like this:
menufontsize=15

 -Just remember to change the vertical offset as well. that setting looks like this:
menujump=15

 -To change the font, find the name of a system font thats monospace, and enter it in this setting:
menufont=mono

 -While the default width is sized automatically to 80 columns, the height is set in the configuration. adjust to your preference.
menuheight=460

--- Image preview settings ---

If you have a slow internet connection, or a slow computer, you may wish to adjust the image preview settings. Likewise, you may also want to increase the number of previewed images as well.

 -To do either of these things, use this setting. (note that setting this to 0 disables image previewing outright):
imgpreview=10

--- Menu window history size limit ---

 -This will limit how many history entries zoxenpher will keep for each gopher menu. history entries are cached.
histsize=10


--- Default Window Size ---

If 800x600 is not your desired window size, you can change it. via these settings:
(note: this refers to the "main" zoxenpher window, not the smaller "sub-windows".)

 -width:
deskw=800

 -height:
deskh=600


--- Strazoloidwm frame style ---

choose what builtin frame style strazoloidwm should use.
(0=plain, 1=3D (without bevels), 2=3D (with bevels, default)
plain is a sparse theme, and is based on strazoloid's original frame look, hence the different placement of buttons.

framestyle=2
